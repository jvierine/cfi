# Wind field correlation function inversion 

A set of Python scripts to allow estimating second order correlation functions of wind from one dimensional projections of wind measured at random points in space and time. The main application is studies of turbulence in the mesosphere-lower thermosphere when using multi-static meteor radar measurements of specular meteor trail echo Doppler shifts. 

Please use as you wish. Reuse, copy, modify etc. I would appreciate if you cite my paper if you find the code or the method useful:
